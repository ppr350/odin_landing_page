About This Odin Project's Landing Page

I am doing a landing page of a webpage about my photoshoot of Iron Man diecast figures. The Odin Project provides guidelines for this project and I am doing my best to meet all the guidelines by using all the things that I have learned from it.


Me and Iron Man Photography (and PhotoShop)

I am self-learning PhotoShop for a long time and I am a hobbyist photographer. I am also a big fan of the Marvellous Iron Man. I have spent around 2 years doing my "Iron Man Photography" project. Which I would like to show in this landing page.
