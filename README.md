About This Odin Project's Landing Page

I am doing a landing page project about my photoshoot of Iron Man diecast figures. The Odin Project provides guidelines for this project and I am doing my best to meet all the guidelines by using all the things that I have learned from it.


Me and Iron Man Photography (and PhotoShop)

I am self-learning PhotoShop for a long time and I am a hobbyist photographer. I am also a big fan of the Marvellous Iron Man. I have spent around 2 years doing my "Iron Man Photography" project. Which I would like to show in this landing page.


What I need to do

The Odin Project's Flexbox Landing Page project provides a design with some details about the fonts and colors. It wants us as learners to use it as a reference and allows us to change the design should we want to. The Odin Project team has taught us most of the necessary skills that are needed to finished this project.

I decided to follow the design of the template provided by The Odin Project team. Mainly focus on recreating the look of the deisgn, at the same time tackle the problems when I am working on the project. Some problems were new to me, and I managed to iron out them by searching solutions on Google and StackOverflow; Some were mistakes that I had made and I was able to solved them by refering back to previous lessons.

One main issue I had faced was the page did not look good on my phone. The layout was all messed up. I eventually make the page looks decent on a smaller screen by using the @media screen rules.
